### What it does?

Shows the weather at your current location. LOL.

### Roadmap [obsolete]

- [x] ~~Basic App Structure~~

- [x] ~~Storing and clearing local data~~

- [ ] Weather of custom city function

- [ ] No reload on User data clear

- [ ] Retry funtion on no internet connection

- [ ] Automatic weather load on app launch instead of clicking "Continue my experience"

- [ ] More beautiful "about app" UI instead of an alert.



### Known Bugs [obsolete]

- When you enter your name on first run, It shows a blank screen. App needs to be restarted. However, It remembers yours name and should work fine from there.

- Sometimes, you need to click "continue my experience" multiple times to work. Sometimes, it doesn't work at all. In that case, app needs to be restarted.

- App UI zooms in and out by pinching.



### Requirements to run [obsolete]

- Xcode 10 or later

- iOS 12.1 or later

### How to run:

Run *WeatherApp.xcodeproj* by double click.
